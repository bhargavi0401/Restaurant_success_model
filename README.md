# Restaurant Closure Prediction Model

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that can determine whether a restaurant is likely to close within a 4-year period. The model aims to provide valuable insights for restaurant lenders (such as banks) and investors, helping them make informed decisions based on the predicted likelihood of closure.

## Overview

In the dynamic and competitive restaurant industry, understanding the factors that contribute to the likelihood of closure is crucial for making strategic decisions. This predictive model leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze relevant features and predict the probability of a restaurant closing within the next 4 years.

## Data

The model utilizes a dataset containing information about various restaurants, including features such as business metrics, location, and other relevant factors. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for training the machine learning models.

## Methodology

The project employs several machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The models were trained on a carefully split dataset, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
